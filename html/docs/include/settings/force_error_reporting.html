<p>This setting is a bitmask, like <a href='https://www.php.net/manual/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting'>error_reporting</a>.
This bitmask will be logically ORed with the bitmask represented by <a
href='https://www.php.net/manual/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting'>error_reporting</a>
to dermine which errors should be displayed. This setting can only be
made in php.ini and allows you to force certain errors from being
shown no matter what an application does with <a
href='https://www.php.net/manual/function.ini-set.php'>ini_set()</a>.</p>
