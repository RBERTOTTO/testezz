Starts recording all notices, warnings and errors and prevents their display
void

FUNC_BASIC

TXT:
When this function is executed, Xdebug will cause PHP not to display any
notices, warnings or errors. Instead, they are formatted according to Xdebug's
normal error formatting rules (ie, the error table with the red exclamation
mark) and then stored in a buffer. This will continue until you call
[FUNC:xdebug_stop_error_collection].

TXT:
This buffer's contents can be retrieved by calling
[FUNC:xdebug_get_collected_errors] and then subsequently displayed. This is
really useful if you want to prevent Xdebug's powerful error reporting features
from destroying your layout.
