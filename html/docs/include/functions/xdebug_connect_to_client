FUNC_STEP_DEBUG

TXT:
This functions instructs Xdebug to try to establish a connection to a debugging
client.

TXT:
Normally, Xdebug tries to start a debugging session at the start of the
request. If a debugging client is not listening at that point, then Xdebug does
not try to re-establish a connection during the remainder of the request.

TXT:
In the situation where one long running PHP process handles multiple tasks,
perhaps from a queue, calling [FUNC:xdebug_connect_to_client] can then be used
to re-try to establish a connection for a specific worker job.
